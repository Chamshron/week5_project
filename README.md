# week5_project
In week 5 of CodeClan, we were tasked with completining a solo python project; I selected the Sports Scoring application.

This project was built using HTML/CSS, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL and the psycopg. 

**Initial Brief**
_Sports Scoring app
Build an app that lets a sports fan keep track of their favourite sports league.
As a huge fan of [your sport], you want to stay up to date with the league. You're interested to see which team leads the table and who won the latest games/matches/fixtures/bouts/â€¦
MVP:
The app should allow the user to create, edit and remove teams in the league
The user should be able to create new games
There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
The app should display if a game was won or lost
Possible Extensions:
Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
Anything else you can think of_

**Updated Brief**
_The initial brief was too vague so I created an updated brief that was more structured.

The European Kendo Federation has reached out to you to create a sport scoring application for their coaches; this app would allow the user to create, edit, and remove teams; allow the user to create new games; allow the user to view all games for a team and all teams in a game; allow the user to see if a game was won or lost.
MVP:
- The app should allow the user to create, edit, and remove teams.
- The user should be able to create a new game.
- There should be able to display all games for a team and all teams in a game.
- The app should show if a game was won or lost.
Extensions:
- The app should allow the user to add players to their team and remove them. 
- The app should allow the user to delete a game. 
- The app should show if a game ended in a draw.
- The app should not allow the same team to be selected twice for one match.
Extended Extensions:
- The app should be able to display all players for a team.
- The app should show the different categories the individual players are competing in as well.
- The app should show a ranking of highest number of wins to lowest number of wins. _

**  What I learned**

This project was completed within a few working days and was my first solo project. I learned a lot from this project however, in the future I think I will spend more time on CSS as I relied too much on tables.
